# EZ-AFM
Quick and easy simulations of atomic force microscopy (AFM)-like pulling of macromolecules, using a simple Go-like model with Brownian dynamics.

Generate paramter files using gen-top, then run dynamics with main-prog.

All the files (`crd`, `psf`, `dcd`, `prm` and `rtf`) generated will be compatible with CHARMM package for further analysis.

Program currently under testing and debugging.
