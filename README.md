# EZ-AFM
Quick and easy simulations of atomic force microscopy (AFM)-like pulling of macromolecules, using Martini model in Brownian dynamics with hydrodynamic interactions (BD-HI).

The binary trajectory file is compatible with CHARMM for future GEOMETRIC analysis.

Program currently under testing and debugging.
