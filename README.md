# EZ-AFM
Quick and easy simulations of atomic force microscopy (AFM)-like pulling of macromolecules, using Martini model in Brownian dynamics with hydrodynamic interactions (BD-HI).

All the files (crd, psf, dcd, prm and rtf) generated will be compatible with CHARMM package for further analysis.

Program currently under testing and debugging.
